A MESSAGE FROM STUDIO FOUNDER, HIDEO KOJIMA

From Sapiens to Ludens  
We are Homo Ludens (Those who Play).

From the moment we enter this world,  
We instinctively invent ways to have "fun",  
and share our inventions with those around us.  
We are not asked to do this,  
nor do we need reasons to create.  
It is simply who we are.

We find one another and compete with one another.  
We laugh together and cry together: all while playing together.  
Our experiences bind us and liberate us.  
To share our most valuable experiences,  
we create stories, invent tools, and evolve the art of play.  
Play has been our ally since the dawn of civilization.

"Playing" is not simply a pastime,  
it is the primordial basis of imagination and creation.  
Truth be told, Homo Ludens (Those who Play) are  
simultaneously Homo Faber (Those who Create).

Even if the Earth were stripped  
of life and reduced to a barren wasteland, our imagination and desire  
to create would persevere beyond survival,  
it would provide hope that flowers may one day bloom again.  
Through the invention of play, our new evolution awaits.

KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS  
We are Homo Ludens. We are those who play.

# Our Journey

## TOMORROW IS IN YOUR HANDS.

In the near future, mysterious explosions have rocked the globe, setting off a series of supernatural events known as the Death Stranding. With otherworldly creatures plaguing the landscape, and mass extinction imminent, it’s up to Sam Porter Bridges to travel across the ravaged wasteland and save humanity from impending annihilation.

## SHOULD WE HAVE CONNECTED ?

Embark on an inspiring mission of human connection beyond the UCA. Sam—with companions by his side—sets out on a new journey to save humanity from extinction. Join them as they traverse a world beset by otherworldly enemies, obstacles and a haunting question: should we have connected? Step by step, legendary game creator Hideo Kojima changes the world once again.
